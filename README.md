## ðŸ“„ Abstract

In the light if GNNs being bounded by WL-test we tried to find other ways of measuring graph similarities without embedding them into Euclidean spaces and losing information. We created some distance functions as one way of measuring similarity, and proved many properties a distance function could have theoretically. Then we experimented on some classical Machine Learning tasks that easily incorporate a distance function and saw how they perform compared to when using other distances and kernels. For Better ML task results we encourage incorporating these distances in more sophisticated ML and DL methods.
